# Project Directory Structure

Here's an overview of the directory structure for our project:

- **`public`**: This folder contains background images and other public contents for the site.

- **`src`**: The client-side business code resides here.

  - **`src/app`**: This directory houses the secondary endpoint of the site.

  - **`src/assets`**: All digital media, including images, videos, and gifs, can be found in this folder.

  - **`src/components`**: Reusable components are organized in this directory.

  - **`src/contexts`**: You'll find contexts and context providers for the project here.

  - **`src/hooks`**: Custom hooks are stored in this folder.

  - **`src/layout`**: There are two main types of layouts available: "blank" and "main."

  - **`src/pages`**: Page-level code is located in this directory.

  - **`src/routes`**: Routing-related code can be found in this folder.

  - **`src/utils`**: Utility functions are organized within this directory.

This structured organization helps us maintain and develop our project efficiently by keeping related code and assets organized in a clear and logical manner.
